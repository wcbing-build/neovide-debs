Description: This is a simple graphical user interface for Neovim
 (an aggressively refactored and updated Vim editor). 
 Where possible there are some graphical improvements, but functionally
 it should act like the terminal UI.
 To checkout all the cool features, installation instructions,
 configuration settings and much more, head on over to neovide.dev.
